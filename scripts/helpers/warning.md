:::{warning}
These benchmarks are automatically run on GitHub Actions' free hosted runners. As
a result, the servers used are using virtual CPU cores, have very limited resources
and may not represent real-world benchmarks.

I **strongly recommend running these benchmarks on your own machine** to ensure that
the results you see are as relevant as possible.

:::{note}
I am looking into acquiring faster servers for the benchmarks, but LibRapid does not
currently have the resources or funding to do so.
